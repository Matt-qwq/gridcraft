# Gaps

> **Last reviewed:** 2026-10-11 · **Last updated:** 2026-10-29 · **Change:** minor (XLSX pass-through keeps slicers, timelines, table query tables and unknown `extLst`, with a strict package validator; gaps §3 moves to 0–2 h left) · **Target:** Microsoft Excel (Microsoft 365)

Every known shortfall against Excel, one entry each, ranked by user impact (what blocks someone
using GridCraft for real work first). This is the work list: pick from the top, check the open
PRs first (50 open on 2026-10-10; several already address entries here), and update the entry
when you land work. Estimates are Opus 5.5 agent-hours. Area detail lives in the linked parity
docs; the summary is in [target-app-parity.md](target-app-parity.md).

Kinds: **F** feature · **U** UI/UX · **FF** file format · **H** hardware · **L** localization ·
**P** performance · **S** stability.

## Beta blockers

No alpha blockers: every core workflow passes the [alpha gate](roadmap.md#alpha-gate).


### 1. XLSX output not proven in Excel or on real files (FF)
- **Missing:** a run over a real-world XLSX corpus, and confirmation that Excel opens what we save
  with no repair prompt (PivotTables, charts, CF, validation, dynamic arrays, tables).
- **Evidence:** round-trip tests cover our own files only (`crates/xlsx/src/tests/`); PivotTable
  round-trip noted as "unverified in real Excel" since 10-07; #64 (dynamic-array flag) shows the
  class of bug.
- **Impact:** the main format; a repair prompt or silent loss destroys trust.
- **Estimate:** 15–25 h, plus owner time in Excel. [file-format-parity.md](file-format-parity.md)

### 2. Large workbooks: what remains of the open/save problem (P, H)
- **Landed (10-24):** the read path streams a worksheet as it decompresses, decodes windows on
  eight threads, packs row bands inside those threads (`BandBatch`), and inflates the next window
  while the last decodes; the write path walks the store once and compresses at level 3. The 118 MB
  report of 31,709,565 cells now opens in 4.1 s (6.1 s on the desktop) at 549 MB of working set and
  saves in 10.8 s; the 1.28 GB report opens in 5.2 s at 569 MB.
- **Landed (10-26):** the store's rows are band-level stripes now (bitmaps, kinds, payloads and
  styles one vector a band with a slice a row) instead of four vectors a row: a range scan costs
  2.9 ns a cell instead of 3.9, packing is 10% cheaper, and the 118 MB report opens in 1.37 s
  holding 155 MiB of cells (191 MiB), digest unchanged; details and the A/B in
  [`roadmap.md`](roadmap.md#m19--cold-paging--6090-h). The 163 MiB first reported was the
  breakdown counting the text and style dictionaries twice, now fixed.
- **Measured (10-26) at 100 million cells:** a 551 MiB, 10-sheet export opens in 6.4 s and holds
  2.4 GB (24 B/cell); its per-band dictionaries are 1.3 GB of that, because every id and amount is
  distinct. Report-shaped data at the same count extrapolates to ~490 MiB. So the M19 acceptance
  (≤ 600 MB) holds at report density and paging is what the unique-key export needs.
- **Landed (10-27): the 100k-dependent edit gate.** An edit of A1 with 100,000 `=$A$1*2` cells costs
  **65–75 ms** against the 100 ms gate (was 245 ms; a full recalculation of the same sheet fell from
  281–289 to 134–147 ms), single-threaded, 0.65–0.75 µs a formula. The pass reads parsed formulas and
  legacy array ranges from the dependency graph instead of rebuilding 100k cells, keeps one `Slot`
  per result (in-progress is an empty value), writes values row-major through
  `CellStore::set_values`, shares each row's `Arc<RowExtras>` in a band copied for undo, charges undo
  from a cached `Formula::expr_bytes`, diffs before looking for legacy array anchors, and reads a
  single-cell reference without an area vector. Details and the phase split in
  [`roadmap.md`](roadmap.md#m18--vectorized-aggregation-kernels--3045-h).
- **Landed (10-27, second round): multi-threaded recalculation of independent formulas.** A pass now
  evaluates its leaves in up to eight shards (one expression/result map each), writes them in row
  order, and repeats for the next layer (up to 16 waves); a whole-column precedent, a dynamic or
  array formula in the dirty set, or iterative calculation keeps the pass sequential, and a spill or
  cycle rolls the parallel results back. `CellStore::set_values` clones touched bands in workers for
  large batches. An edit of A1 with 100,000 `=$A$1*2` cells is **20–25 ms** end to end (was 65–75),
  200k is ~35–42 ms, 500k ~100–132 ms and 1M ~208–277 ms in `_gridcraft-bench/calcbench`; the 100k
  full recalculation is 89–114 ms. Details in [`roadmap.md`](roadmap.md#m18--vectorized-aggregation-kernels--3045-h).
- **Landed (10-28): bulk edits and whole-sheet data commands.** `Calc::cells_changed` used to scan
  a 64×64 block for blocked arrays **per changed cell**; a 10M-cell Remove Duplicates therefore did
  ~40 billion block visits. It now scans the union of the changed blocks once (or keeps the per-cell
  scan when the changed cells are scattered), and the same 10M-cell Remove Duplicates fell from
  **91 s to 12 s** (1M×3: 15.4 → 5.3 s); its recalculation phase went from ~80 s to 1.4 s. Sort on
  the same 1M×10 sheet is **3.2 s** (recalculation 0.02 s) and Fill Down on 1M rows **1.45 s**.
  `data.sort`, `data.removeDuplicates` and `range.setValues` share a **12M-cell cap** (1M×10 fits;
  1M×20 is refused in 1.3 s with a clear error), and `CellStore::style`/Remove Duplicates parse a
  style's number format once rather than once a cell.
- **Landed (10-28): the per-band text index goes away when a band is finished.** The sorted
  pointer→slot index is only needed while cells are being added, so `Band::finish` drops it and the
  first edit rebuilds it; a completed band keeps one `Arc<str>` per distinct text. The 100M-cell
  unique-key export drops from 2,411 to **1,911 MiB** live (texts 640 → 301 MiB; number tables 679 → 519 MiB), digest unchanged.
- **Landed (10-28): cold paging.** Completed bands are compressed into per-sheet `GPB1` page files
  (zlib, fast) and read back through a 4,096-band LRU; the engine pages packages over 200 MB, so the
  55 MB 1M×10 sheet stays live. The 100M-cell export opens with **16.7 MiB live and 183.1 MiB peak**
  (was 1.91 GB live) and 729.5 MiB of compressed pages on disk; its digest is cell-for-cell the same
  with and without paging. The 31.7M report stays live at 49.7 MiB and opens in 1.47 s. Page files
  are removed with the store; a corrupt or truncated page is refused.
- **Landed (10-28): row inserts/deletes are a logical→physical map.** `CellStore::shift_rows`
  changes a segment list instead of moving cells; a gap row gets a fresh physical key when written,
  and reads/iteration/used range/formulas map through. Insert one row above a 1M×20 sheet is
  **3.7 ms command / 35.8 ms commit**, with no cell moved. The formula rewrite no longer walks every
  cell to find none (it reads the store's formula side tables), and iteration skips empty bands.
- **Landed (10-28): the column sibling.** `ColMap` materializes only the used width, allocates a
  fresh physical column for a written insert (or reuses a deleted one), and maps reads/iteration/
  formulas/used range. A column insert at A in the same 1M×20 sheet is **9.8 ms / 42.5 ms commit**,
  no cell moved. Save/reopen tests cover both axes; column-mapped value writes take the
  value-at-a-time path.
- **Landed (10-29): row/column line metadata is a physical-id map too.** `Sheet.rows`/`cols` are a
  `LineMap`: the store's logical→physical runs with the entries in 128-line `Arc` chunks. A row or
  column insert/delete moves runs instead of reindexing every custom height, hidden line or
  outline entry, an undo snapshot shares untouched chunks, and JSON/XLSX still store logical lines.
  Insert inheritance, delete, undo and a mapped-sheet XLSX round trip are covered (model 62,
  engine 419, xlsx 265 tests). The UI also caches the derived `LineIndex`/outline axes per
  `(document, revision, sheet)`, so a 1M-custom-height sheet no longer rebuilds them every frame.
- **Landed 10-29: per-sheet save.** Worksheet XML deflates on a background worker as each sheet
  is written; the archive mixes raw/pre-deflated parts in order, and wasm uses inline/sequential
  paths. The 100M-cell save now peaks at **1,814.3 MiB in 28.42 s** (was 6,049.8 MiB / 26.37 s),
  and `real_117m` at 1,283.9 MiB in 3.48 s; output hashes are unchanged. Only the deferred
  page-file rewrite and post-beta streaming save remain.
- **Landed (10-29): writer ownership.** `ZipOut::add` takes each part `Vec` instead of copying it,
  `write_zip` moves each part into its deflate worker and drops it there, and the zip64 decision is
  taken before compression from a whole-archive bound. Output is byte-identical (37,153 bytes pinned
  by test); a worker panic fails the save instead of writing an empty part. The writer still holds
  every sheet's XML until layout, so per-sheet release (S4b) remains.
- **Landed (10-29): spill beside the document.** A paging read creates the page file in the
  document's folder (temp fallback), with `GRIDCRAFT_SPILL=temp|off`, a UNC skip, a sanitized name,
  Unix 0600 + unlink-after-open and Windows delete-on-close. A write failure latches spilling off
  while existing pages stay readable; no file means the workbook opens live with one warning.
- **Landed (10-29): byte-budget page cache and uncached save scan.** The decoded-band cache is
  64 MiB by default (`GRIDCRAFT_PAGE_CACHE_MB` clamped 8–512), shared per page file, charged at
  decode with generation/`Weak` eviction and `PageCacheStats`. `iter_scan`/`visit_scan` decode one
  band at a time without touching it, and the XLSX writer uses that path: a save leaves the
  viewport's cache exactly unchanged and no longer collects a 16k-wide band.
- **Landed (10-29): mapped value writes and packed folds.** `set_values` streams through the row
  map's logical runs and keeps a run-merged parallel plan; 1M values after a row insert write in
  **35 ms** (was 131–135), after a column insert 33 ms (was 116–142). `visit_packed` follows the
  column map's runs, so a dense block is **2.5–3.3 ns/cell** (was 30.6), and the owned/formula gate
  resolves a band once (1M paged rows 0.84 ms, was 9.5). `diff` keeps its documented physical
  contract; `diff_logical` is the O(cells) map-independent diagnostic for tests/fuzz.
- **Missing:** dependent chains that never become a wave of leaves remain sequential; whole-sheet
  clear/copy/paste still clone the stored cells (they scale with the data, not the file); the
  per-band value dictionaries still cost full price when values do not repeat;
  page-aware compaction and the 64 MiB byte-budget page cache landed 10-29 (identity early-out,
  gap-scoped candidates, snapshot-safe page replacement, `document.compact` and a save hook,
  `PageCacheStats`); a page-file rewrite remains;
  whole-column references are already clipped (`SUM(A:A)` folds a million numeric cells in 21.5 ms,
  a ten-row used range in 0.0 ms). The 159 cells that still differ from the cached values of the
  1.28 GB report are Excel's stale cache — 276 cells of the same `IFERROR(XLOOKUP(...))` shape in the
  same workbook cache `#N/A` — not a calculation difference.
- **Evidence:** `crates/xlsx/src/sheet_read.rs`, `crates/model/src/store.rs`, `crates/model/src/line.rs`,
  `docs/roadmap.md` (M17–M21), and the harness kept beside the fork (`_gridcraft-bench/`).
- **Impact:** finance and data users routinely have big workbooks.
- **Status (10-29): the large-workbook beta gate is met.** Recalc, edit latency, 1M-row operations,
  bounded data commands and memory all pass their targets; M19 cold paging and the M20 row/column
  maps landed. Remaining work is base hardening, not capacity: M19 spill placement, flat-memory
  save/scan (and the deferred page-file rewrite) are wave 0 in
  [`roadmap.md`](roadmap.md#execution-queue). The M21 Parquet read half is post-beta. The old
  estimate is superseded by those waves.

### 3. Some unmodelled XLSX content is dropped on save (FF)
- **Landed (10-29):** pass-through keeps slicers and their caches, timelines and their caches,
  table-attached query tables, and unknown `extLst` children on the workbook, worksheet, table,
  PivotTable and pivot cache definition. Part bytes come back byte-identical, rels are re-pointed
  with their ids preserved, and every kept fragment is keyed to its owner (`table:`, `pivot:`,
  `pivotcache:`): a deleted, renamed or replaced owner drops its extras, the parts only they reach
  and the rels in the same save, so no dangling relationship is written. A strict package validator
  (every rel target exists, every part has a content type, no orphans, no case-only duplicate
  names, no stale `Override`, no duplicate rel ids) runs inside `write_xlsx` for every save in the
  crate's tests. The earlier set (#330) still holds: custom XML, external links, connections, sheet
  query tables, printer settings, controls/ActiveX/OLE/backgrounds, header-footer pictures,
  chart sheets, workbook and worksheet `extLst`.
- **Missing:** the data model (Power Pivot `xl/model/…`, `powerPivotData`), chart `extLst` and chart
  details (a chart part has no stable identity to key a fragment on; chart depth is #4), Strict Open
  XML content. A renamed table or PivotTable loses its extras by policy — misattaching a query table
  is worse than dropping it — which is a product decision worth revisiting.
- **Not verified:** whether Excel opens a re-saved slicer/timeline workbook without a repair prompt
  (needs the owner's Excel half-day, #1). No Excel run has happened.
- **Evidence:** `crates/xlsx/src/passthrough.rs` (what is kept, and why the rest isn't);
  `crates/xlsx/src/testing.rs` (`check_package`); the matrix in
  [file-format-parity.md](file-format-parity.md).
- **Impact:** open-edit-save no longer simplifies workbooks with slicers, timelines or query tables;
  Power Pivot workbooks still lose the model.
- **Estimate:** 0–2 h left of the 6–10, plus the Excel check folded into #1.
  [file-format-parity.md](file-format-parity.md)

### 4. Charts lose options on round trip; shallow chart model (F, FF)
- **Landed (10-29):** the model carries, and reads/writes/draws, axis scaling (min, max, major unit,
  log base, reversed, crossing, display units, number format), data labels (value, percentage,
  series name, category name, legend key, position, separator, number format, per-series visibility,
  per-point deletion), error bars per series (fixed, percentage, sample standard deviation, standard
  error, custom `numRef`/`numLit`, both directions, `noEndCap`) and per-point fill/line/marker
  colour. Four commands: `chart.setAxis`, `chart.setDataLabels`, `chart.setErrorBars`,
  `chart.formatPoint` — a chart kind that cannot store an option refuses it rather than holding a
  dead value. An unmodelled chart part is kept byte-identically while the chart is untouched, and
  `chart_options_roundtrip` pins build → save → reopen → second save byte equality. Catalog
  274 → 279 / 290 → 295.
- **Missing (in flight):** field-level pass-through (the first edit still drops unmodelled XML),
  secondary and date axes, category-axis bounds drawn, charts of unmodelled kinds (3-D, surface,
  pie-of-pie, Pareto) whose frame lives in the drawing part, chartex options, per-point label text.
  The UI side — the Format pane driving the four commands and chart **resize** (#190) — has not
  started.
- **Evidence:** `Chart` holds only title, legend position, two flags and axis titles
  (`crates/model/src/features.rs`); PRs #158, #161 open; charts can't be resized (#190). Smooth lines (#62), Switch Row/Column (#116) and trendlines (read, written, drawn) landed. Multi-level category axes (year beside month) are read, drawn and written back.
  (`crates/model/src/features.rs`); all 2-D kinds survive XLSX round trip (#158, #161); charts
  can't be resized (#190). Smooth lines (#62), Switch Row/Column (#116) and trendlines (read,
  written, drawn) landed.
- **Impact:** charts are in most business workbooks.
- **Estimate:** 25–35 h for beta (40–60 h full). [chart-parity.md](chart-parity.md)

### 5. Text in non-Latin scripts doesn't render or export (L)
- **Landed 10-29 (PDF half):** `gridcraft-core::fonts` finds a font file (`CRAFT_FONTS_DIR`, then the
  platform's font directories, plain `read_dir`, no fontconfig) and answers per-character coverage
  from `cmap`; `gridcraft-pdf` reads TrueType, subsets it (composite closure, rebuilt tables) and
  embeds a `CIDFontType2` with `FontFile2`, `Identity-H`, `/W` and a `ToUnicode` CMap, so Latin
  Extended, Greek, Cyrillic, Hebrew, Arabic, Devanagari, Thai, CJK and Hangul text reaches the page
  instead of vanishing. One face per document, chosen by coverage; ASCII/WinAnsi documents keep
  their **previous bytes** (proven by a byte-for-byte test and by the untouched golden) because the
  engine only resolves a font when a character falls outside WinAnsi. Verified with `pdftotext`.
- **Still missing:** **shaping** (Arabic joining, Devanagari reordering/conjuncts, Thai mark
  positioning) and **bidi** — glyphs are correct but unjoined and stored-order, so RTL sheets print
  LTR; CJK and Arabic cannot both be embedded in one document (no single face covers both, stated in
  the matrix); CFF/OTF (`CIDFontType0`) and TTC faces past index 0 are not embedded; the grid's own
  rendering is a separate task in `crates/ui-egui`.
- **Evidence:** the matrix in [localization-parity.md](localization-parity.md); #142, #54.
- **Impact:** PDF export and printing no longer drops most of the world's scripts; on-screen shaping
  and right-to-left layout are still English-centric.
- **Estimate:** 6–12 h left of the 12–20 (shaping + bidi in the UI text path).
  [localization-parity.md](localization-parity.md)

### 6. Calculation correctness bugs (F)
- **Missing:** nothing known. The four this entry tracked have landed: 15-significant-digit
  equality (#57, so `=0.1+0.2=0.3` is TRUE and MATCH and COUNTIF agree), spill updates after
  structural edits and cleared blockers (#133, #139; PRs #148, #157), 3-D span deletion (#140),
  and qualified names after a sheet rename (#134). Iterative calculation for circular references
  landed too (no Options dialog yet, which is §13's).
- **Impact:** wrong numbers are worse than missing features, so this entry is kept until the
  oracle suite of §15 can say the category is clear rather than only these five reports being so.
- **Estimate:** — [function-parity.md](function-parity.md#formula-language)

### 7. Legacy `.xls` only partly read; encrypted workbooks can't be saved with a password (FF)
- **Evidence:** #121: Excel 97-2003 (BIFF8) `.xls` files now open (values, formulas, number
  formats, merges, sizes, names); fonts, fills, borders, charts, pictures, comments, conditional
  formats, validation and BIFF5 files are not read, and `.xls` is never written. Password-encrypted
  `.xlsx` workbooks (Agile and Standard encryption) open with their password since #11, but are
  saved without it: GridCraft can't write an encrypted file yet. Encrypted `.xls` (FILEPASS) and
  RC4-encrypted files are still refused with a message.
- **Impact:** common in finance, government and anything older than 2007; encrypted files are
  routine in business.
- **Estimate:** 14–21 h (`.xls` styles and objects 10–15, encryption 4–6). [file-format-parity.md](file-format-parity.md)

### 8. PivotTables: no slicers, calculated items, PivotCharts; unverified in Excel (F)
- **Evidence:** `parity-checklist.md` missing `insert.slicer`, `insert.timeline`,
  `insert.pivotChart`, `table.insertSlicer`; calculated items and GETPIVOTDATA missing (calculated fields
  and values on rows done).
- **Impact:** pivots are the analyst's main tool.
- **Estimate:** 20–30 h for beta (25–40 h full).

### 9. Keyboard-first users: key tips, shortcuts, context menus (U)
- **Landed (10-29):** key tips now cover the whole ribbon — 417 sequences across every tab, group
  and button (contextual tabs switch with their context), served by one JSON source of truth
  (`crates/ui-egui/src/keytips/keytips.json`) and a generated table kept in step by
  `cargo xtask keytips --check`. `Alt` shows the badges, a typed sequence activates, `Esc` cancels
  at any depth. Tests enforce sequence length ≤ 4, per-scope uniqueness, no shadowing (two-way
  prefix), tab reachability, that every badge resolves to a catalog command, and one end-to-end
  test per sequence (419). `Shift+F10` opens the context menu at the selection for cells and for
  row/column headers, navigable with arrows/Home/End/Enter/Space/Esc; the grid keeps focus and the
  selection, and Space cannot start an edit behind the menu. Six Excel shortcuts were added on
  commands that already existed (`Alt+;`, `Ctrl+Shift+O`, `Ctrl+F2`, `Ctrl+Shift+F12`, `Alt+F5`,
  `Ctrl+Alt+F5`). The full Excel → command-id → status audit is in [ui-parity.md](ui-parity.md).
- **Still missing:** the Menu key itself (egui-winit 0.36 drops `KeyCode::ContextMenu` before the app
  and egui has no `Key` variant for it), context menus for charts/pictures/shapes from the keyboard,
  QAT/title bar/Backstage badges, the View tab's two combo boxes, and per-item badges in menus whose
  items share one command id. Remaining Excel shortcuts map to features we do not have yet (Quick
  Analysis, extend mode, pane cycling, sheet groups, Paste Name, Repeat, outline symbols, formula-bar
  expand, window keys).
- **Estimate:** 0–6 h of the 12–20 left (the missing extras above). [ui-parity.md](ui-parity.md)

### 10. Crashes and freezes reported from the field (S)
- **Evidence:** #120 (Intel UHD crash on Windows), #117 (error on close, macOS), #166 (freeze opening
  from Finder; PRs #164, #167), #76 (flashing on Windows 11), #130 (caught panic in table styles).
- **Landed (10-26): a 100-seed command-sequence soak.** 200 commands a seed in release build, every
  invariant checked per step (`crates/engine/tests/command_sequence_fuzz.rs`). Found and fixed:
  Merge Across of whole columns ran 1,048,576 merges and then re-scanned the sheet per row (a
  freeze); a table's total row could grow into the next table; `data.subtotal` took a dozen undo
  steps per group instead of one; a table column named with `!` was saved as a sheet-qualified
  formula and came back changed. The harness now ends an episode before the 128 MB undo budget
  trims it, traces steps with `GRIDCRAFT_FUZZ_TRACE`, and names the differing sheet field.
- **Fixed (10-26, same soak):** an array that spills over its own source (`=TRANSPOSE(J23:L28)`
  in J24) was laid out anyway, with some elements `#CIRC!`; it is now `#CIRC!` at the anchor, as a
  formula that reads a cell it writes. And two arrays whose areas overlap kept their cells across
  F9 instead of being re-laid out in row-major order (`=SEQUENCE(7,4)` at K7 beside `=SEQUENCE(6,5)`
  at L2).
- **Fixed (10-27): a 500-seed soak is green.** 200 commands a seed (100,000 commands, release,
  49 minutes) over the three samples, every invariant checked per step. The three open seeds from
  the 100-seed run are gone: on read, a dynamic anchor's `ref` is rebuilt into `spill_ranges` and
  the cached interior values become the spill map, not cells that block the array, so a reload
  keeps the array that won a contested area; F9 prefers the anchors that actually spill, and an
  owner that grows back after a spill it reads is laid out later reclaims its cells. `#SPILL!`/
  `#CALC!` cached as `#VALUE!` is compared as what the file can store, not as a changed value.
  The `_sc_*` names (Watch Window list, custom views, scripts, scenarios) are view state and
  formulas can no longer resolve them. Further seeds found and fixed: a formula that reads its own
  cell through a range and swallows the `#CIRC!` (`COUNTIF` over its own column) is `#CIRC!`
  instead of a number that depended on evaluation order; a filter installed over a selection that
  covers a table is narrowed to the table's filter range, so its criteria reach the table part and
  SUBTOTAL still skips the hidden rows after opening; a multi-cell legacy array that cannot spill
  still refuses edits of its cells; Insert/Delete Cells that would cut a merged area in two is
  refused; the harness tells a byte-capped (trimmed) undo history from a real undo bug, and
  ignores view-only freeze in undo comparisons.
- **Remaining caveat:** the file format cannot cache `#SPILL!`/`#CALC!` (GridCraft writes
  `#VALUE!`, following the claim that Excel refuses those error codes; **needs verification on a
  licensed Excel**) or `#CIRC!` (written as 0). A *literal* `#SPILL!` pasted as a value therefore
  comes back `#VALUE!`; formulas and spilled values are recalculated and agree.
- **Next:** the trust track's soak is closed; the 100k-dependent gate is met, independent formulas
  recalculate on up to eight threads (20–25 ms at 100k, 208–277 ms at 1M) and the bulk data
  commands are bounded (12M cells; Remove Duplicates 1M×10 in 12 s, Sort in 3.2 s, gaps §2). Cold
  paging (M19) is the next large-workbook task. Replays and details in `plan/HANDOVER.md`.
- **Estimate:** 12–16 h for this soak and its fixes; done.
## After beta

### 11. No localization at all (L)
- Catalog: ribbon-only in five languages (#31, #104, #82; ~12% of strings each), and 943 strings
  (~43%) in Japanese (10-17) and Brazilian Portuguese, including the dialog labels, messages, File
  view and menus. The remaining dialogs, menus and messages are English; en-US function names and
  separators (#45); German in PR #163. **Estimate:**
  100–165 h including #5. [localization-parity.md](localization-parity.md)

### 12. Get & Transform, external data, data model (F)
- No Power Query editor, connections, refresh, From Web/database/folder sources, relationships or
  data model (`data.fromWeb`, `data.relationships` missing). **Estimate:** 60–100 h.

### 13. Analysis tools: Solver, Analysis ToolPak, Forecast Sheet (F)
- `data.solver`, `data.analysisToolPak` missing. Forecast Sheet (`data.forecastSheet`) and the
  FORECAST.ETS family are in, including Forecast Start (hindcast, #785). **Estimate:** 15–25 h.
- Solver (`data.solver`, #327) has Simplex LP with integer/binary branch and bound, a local
  nonlinear method (augmented Lagrangian, not GRG), the Evolutionary method, and Answer and
  Limits reports. Report refusal leaves the solution, saved model and history unchanged; a
  successful solve and its reports share one Undo step (#1050). AllDifferent constraints,
  the Solver Options dialog, the Sensitivity and Population reports and Load/Save Model remain.
  The Analysis ToolPak
  (`data.analysisToolPak`) has 13 of 19 tools. Forecast Sheet (`data.forecastSheet`) and the
  FORECAST.ETS family are in; the sheet has no Forecast Start (hindcast) option yet. **Estimate:** 12–20 h.

### 14. Page Layout view and print polish (U, F)
- Page Layout view landed (#329): paper view with rulers and in-place header/footer editing.
  Margins are dragged on the rulers (#792). Remaining: pictures in headers/footers, Different First Page / Odd & Even pages. Desktop now submits directly through craft-print with printer choice, copies, duplex and grayscale; browser printing stays available. Print ranges and driver tray/options UI remain. **Estimate:** 5–10 h.

### 15. Remaining functions and an oracle suite (F)
- 18 missing, 9 stubs; no Excel-computed oracle corpus; #137, #138. **Estimate:** 16–26 h.
- 20 missing, 9 stubs; no Excel-computed oracle corpus; #137, #138. **Estimate:** 17–29 h.
- 21 missing, 9 stubs; no Excel-computed oracle corpus; #137, #138. **Estimate:** 18–30 h.
- 18 missing, 9 stubs; no Excel-computed oracle corpus; #137, #138. **Estimate:** 18–30 h.
  [function-parity.md](function-parity.md)

### 16. Collaboration and review (F)
- No co-authoring, Show Changes, comment navigation, notes ↔ comments
  conversion; cloud storage requested (#86). **Estimate:** 35–55 h (co-authoring scope needs the owner).

### 17. Insert objects (F)
- Ink strokes now survive XLSX save/reopen as editable polylines. Inserted icons still lose their
  identity/artwork on save (#551); native Office InkML import is not implemented.
- SmartArt, WordArt, equations, signature line, objects, 3-D models, screenshot; 8 shape kinds vs
  ~170; pictures in cells (#61, PR #105). **Estimate:** 25–40 h.

### 18. Accessibility (U)
- AccessKit on, but no accessible grid/ribbon tree, no high contrast, no checker. **Estimate:** 12–18 h.
  [ui-parity.md](ui-parity.md#accessibility)

### 19. XLSB/ODS beyond values; minor formats (FF)
- XLSB and ODS import values only, no write; no `.prn`, `.dif`, `.slk`, XML Spreadsheet 2003; CSV
  writes raw instead of displayed values; templates saved with the workbook content type.
  **Estimate:** 15–23 h.

### 20. Multiple windows; pen pressure (H)
- One window (#162, PR #171); no pressure or tilt in ink. **Estimate:** 10–14 h.
  [hardware-parity.md](hardware-parity.md)

### 21. Automation and add-ins (F)
- VBA out of scope (dropped on open, #6); no Office Scripts compatibility; no plugin or custom
  function API. **Estimate:** 25–40 h plus an owner decision.

### 22. AI features (F)
- No in-app assistant, natural-language formulas or Analyze Data; agent control via MCP is
  already strong. **Estimate:** 30–50 h; model choice needs the owner.

### 23. Mobile (platform)
- No iOS, iPadOS or Android layout. **Estimate:** 30–60 h.

### 24. Fonts and look (U)
- Font weights beyond regular/bold (#168), system font list (#4), Calibri metrics (#29), macOS
  chrome (#169, #170), Linux title bar (#54), icon consistency across apps (#173). **Estimate:** 7–12 h.

## Revision history

| Date | Change | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-10-28 | minor | §2: a finished band drops its text pointer index (rebuilt on the first edit); the 100M-cell export falls from 2,411 to 1,911 MiB live (texts 640 → 301, number tables 679 → 519) and a text past the u16 slots keeps its own slot |
| 2026-10-28 | minor | §2: bulk changes scan blocked arrays once for the union of the changed cells and data commands cap at 12M cells: Remove Duplicates 1M×10 91 → 12 s, Sort 3.2 s, Fill Down 1.45 s; 1M×20 refused in 1.3 s |
| 2026-10-27 | minor | §2: independent formulas recalculate on up to eight threads (leaves wave by wave; arrays/volatile/iterative sequential): 100k end-to-end 65–75 → 20–25 ms, 1M calc 517–843 → 208–277 ms; §10 next step is bounded whole-sheet work and paging |
| 2026-10-27 | minor | §2: the 100k-dependent edit gate is met single-threaded (245 → 65–75 ms; full recalculation 281–289 → 134–147 ms) by reading formulas and legacy ranges from the graph, one result slot, row-major value writes, shared row extras, cached AST byte counts and a diff-first array check; §10 next step is multi-threaded recalc |
| 2026-10-26 | minor | §10: self-spilling arrays are `#CIRC!` and a contested spill keeps its owner across F9; three seeds remain, two of them the file side of spilled arrays |
| 2026-10-26 | minor | §10: 100-seed soak; Merge Across freeze, total-row overlap, Subtotal undo depth and a `!` column name fixed; four dynamic-array conflict seeds open with replays |
| 2026-10-26 | minor | §2: whole-column references are already clipped (21.5 ms for `SUM(A:A)` over a million cells); a 100k-dependent edit measures 223–251 ms; the 159 remaining cells are Excel's stale cache, not a difference |
| 2026-10-26 | minor | §2: the stripes' report numbers and a 100M-cell measurement (2.4 GB on a unique-key export against ~490 MiB extrapolated at report density); `packed_breakdown` no longer counts two dictionaries twice |
| 2026-10-20 | minor | §11: the Japanese catalog covers the dialogs, messages and menus — 943 keys (~43%), matching the pt-BR coverage; a test keeps the two catalogs in step |
| 2026-10-17 | minor | §6: the five reports it tracked are closed and their PRs merged (#57, #133, #139, #140, #134; PRs #148, #155, #156, #157); the entry stays open for §15's oracle suite |
| 2026-10-15 | minor | §13: Solver prepares reports before committing the solution, model and report sheets together; report refusal preserves the workbook and Undo/Redo (#1050) |
| 2026-10-13 | trivial | §4: multi-level category axes landed |
| 2026-10-12 | minor | §9: next/previous sheet commands retain the current visible sheet and selection when there is no visible destination |
| 2026-10-12 | minor | rows auto-fit oversized fonts on open and whole-row/column formatting (#833) |
| 2026-10-12 | minor | Page Layout view: dragging margins on the rulers (#792) removed from the §14 remainder |
| 2026-10-12 | minor | §13: Forecast Sheet Forecast Start (hindcast) landed (#785) |
| 2026-10-12 | minor | §17: ink geometry survives XLSX saves; the icon portion of #551 remains |
| 2026-10-12 | minor | §8: values on rows (Σ Values in Rows, `dataOnRows`) laid out, moved and round-tripped |
| 2026-10-12 | minor | Desktop File > Print now discovers printers and submits PDF jobs through pinned craft-print with printer choice, copies, duplex and grayscale; browser printing and PDF export remain available. Remaining print parity includes page ranges and driver-specific tray/options UI; physical printer fidelity needs hardware validation. |
| 2026-10-11 | minor | §6: iterative calculation for circular references landed (Maximum Iterations, Maximum Change) |
| 2026-10-11 | minor | §15: trim-reference operators (`A1:.E10`, `A1.:E10`, `A1.:.E10`) parse and evaluate |
